## What is BlurAdmin?

Blur admin is Angular front-end Admin Dashboard template. That means all data you can see on graphs, charts tables is hardcoded in Javascript. You can use any backend you want with it without limitations.

## How can it help me?

We believe that that at the moment a lot of business applications have some kind of admin interface inside of them. Sometimes it's not that obvious, but a lot of web applications have dashboard with panels, charts analytics.

BlurAdmin aims to bootstrap development of your product and provide ecosystem for building a prototype or even production-ready application.

Despite frameworks like Bootstrap provide a number of components, usually it's not enough of them to build real-world app. This template comes with lots of popular UI components with unified color scheme.
